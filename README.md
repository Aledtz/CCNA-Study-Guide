# CCNA-Study-Guide
This is a collection of notes that I personally took while studying for the CCNA 200-301 v1.0 exam. They may be used as a template, guide, or inspiration as to how to organize notes and topics regarding the CCNA.

These collection of notes were taken while following ITProTV's CCNA course, as well as Jeremy's IT Lab and David Bombal's CCNA courses on Udemy. As a result, the topics covered and their order directly relfect that of the mentioned courses above.

I will be adding additional notes that follow along with other online CCNA courses in the very near future as well. I will also add aditional versions of notes that do not include any highlighting or bolding for those who may prefer a cleaner presentation format.

Happy studying!
